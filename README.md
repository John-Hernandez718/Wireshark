# Wireshark


<h1>Installing WireShark</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration Coming Soon]()

<h2>Description</h2>
I meticulously orchestrated the installation of Wireshark on my home computer running Ubuntu 22.04. Starting with a thorough package upgrade to ensure I had the latest versions, I verified the integrity of the software properties and confirmed that the updates were not corrupted. Following this diligence, I proceeded with the installation, encountering a configuration prompt. Finally, I initiated the software through the terminal by executing the 'wireshark' command.
